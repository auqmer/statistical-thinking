title: "Statistical Thinking"
---

This website contains resources relevant to research design and analysis applied social and behavioral sciences. While basic courses in statistics are essential to most graduate programs, they generally are not sufficient to prepare researchers to advance modern fields of inquiry, particularly on the cutting edge of modern empirical work. This site provides resources that not only build upon a researcher's basic understanding of quantitative methods, but also provide access to such information after completing graduate course work.

The menu at the left of the pages will allow you to navigate through the topics. 
There is also a search option which can be used by clicking the magnifying glass in the top right of the site.
The navigation bar at the top of the page has additional links that may be useful.

I hope you find the content useful!
