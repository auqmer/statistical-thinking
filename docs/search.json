      "contents": "\nDr. William (Hank) Murrah,\nPh.D.\nAs an educational researcher, ifocuses on understanding how people\nlearn to think. My work falls into three main areas: (1) studying the\nskills children need to succeed in school; (2) developing interventions\nthat address resource disparities important for learning; (3) developing\nmethods to understand the impact of social and contextual factors on\nlearning, motivation, and achievement. I am co-founder of the\nQuantitative Methods in Educational Research learning community, which\nis dedicated to supporting the growth and development of graduate\nstudents. A major goal of his when working with graduate students is to\nprovide experiences with empirical research that helps them to stand out\nas scholars by providing skills needed to succeed as modern educational\nresearchers.\n\n\n\n",

      "contents": "\nOverview of Website\nThis website contains blog posts, tutorials and other materials\nrelated to modern quantitative methods. While basic courses in\nstatistics are essential to most graduate programs, they generally are\nnot sufficient to prepare researchers to advance modern fields of\ninquiry, particularly on the cutting edge of modern empirical work. This\nsite provides resources that not only build upon a researcher’s basic\nunderstanding of quantitative methods, but also provide access to such\ninformation after completing graduate course work.\nThere are a few basic ways to use this site. You can view our latest\nblog posts as you would the typical blog site by checking out the Posts\ntab. If you want to find posts by the type of methods covered, go to the\nCourses tab, which organized the materials around the way they are\ntaught in graduate school. The content is the same, but the organization\ndiffers. There is also a tab for those interesting in learning the R\nprogramming language, which I use extensively on this site.\nContact\nMaintained by:\nWilliam M.
