      "contents": "\nDr. William (Hank) Murrah, Ph.D.\nAs an educational researcher, ifocuses on understanding how people learn to think. My work falls into three main areas: (1) studying the skills children need to succeed in school; (2) developing interventions that address resource disparities important for learning; (3) developing methods to understand the impact of social and contextual factors on learning, motivation, and achievement.\nI am co-founder of the Quantitative Methods in Educational Research learning community, which is dedicated to supporting the growth and development of graduate students. A major goal of his when working with graduate students is to provide experiences with empirical research that helps them to stand out as scholars by providing skills needed to succeed as modern educational researchers.\n\n\n\n",

      "contents": "\nOverview of Website\nThis website contains blog posts, tutorials and other materials related to modern quantitative methods.\nWhile basic courses in statistics are essential to most graduate programs, they generally are not sufficient to prepare researchers to advance modern fields of inquiry, particularly on the cutting edge of modern empirical work.\nThis site provides resources that not only build upon a researcher’s basic understanding of quantitative methods, but also provide access to such information after completing graduate course work.\nThere are a few basic ways to use this site.\nYou can view our latest blog posts as you would the typical blog site by checking out the Posts tab. If you want to find posts by the type of methods covered, go to the Courses tab, which organized the materials around the way they are taught in graduate school. The content is the same, but the organization differs.\nThere is also a tab for those interesting in learning the R programming language, which I use extensively on this site.\nContact\nMaintained by:\nWilliam M. Murrah, Ph.D.\nAssociate Professor,\nCollege of Education, Auburn University\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
