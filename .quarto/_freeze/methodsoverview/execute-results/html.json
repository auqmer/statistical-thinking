Describe\n2.  Predict\n3.  Explain\n\nModels are important for all these goals.\n\nModels are representations of how our key constructs are related.\nThey can be narrative, graphical, or mathematical.\nModels match reality in some way, and are simpler than reality.\n\n### Why do we need models?\n\nIf we acknowledge the .red\\[**complexity**\\] and\n.red\\[**interrelatedness**\\] of reality, and our goal is the perfect\nmodel, we soon realize **To model anything, we would have to model\neverything**!\n\n**All models are wrong, but some are useful** -*George Box*\n\n### Occam's Razor\n\n-   We need to balance explanatory power (reducing error) with parsimony\n    (simplicity)\n-   We want to constantly ask: \"What do we gain by adding complexity?\"\n-   Proportion Reduction in Error (PRE)\n\n### Scientific Models are NOT Oracles\n\n![](images/oracle-delphi.jpg)\n\n### Scientific Models are Golems\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](images/golem.jpg){width=500 height=10%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Simple Models: Errors and Parameters\n\n### The Basic Model\n\n#### Narrative, Numeric, and Graphical Models\n\nLet's start with a simple narrative model:\n\n\"Peer pressure causes smoking.\"\n\nWe can start to convert this to other forms of model.\nIt is often helpful to take our narrative model an turn it into a graphical model.\n\nHere is a simple graphical model of our example model:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n```{=html}\n<div class=\"grViz html-widget html-fill-item-overflow-hidden html-fill-item\" id=\"htmlwidget-9c4ebe1fe04db5fe9af1\" style=\"width:100%;height:464px;\"></div>\n<script type=\"application/json\" data-for=\"htmlwidget-9c4ebe1fe04db5fe9af1\">{\"x\":{\"diagram\":\"\\ndigraph {\\n  graph []\\n  node [shape = plaintext]\\n    A [label = \\\"Friends smoke\\\"]\\n    Y [label = \\\"Smoking\\\"]\\n  edge []\\n    A->Y\\n{ rank = same; A; Y }\\n}\\n\",\"config\":{\"engine\":\"dot\",\"options\":null}},\"evals\":[],\"jsHooks\":[]}</script>\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nHere is a generalized graphical representation of our model.\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n```{=html}\n<div class=\"grViz html-widget html-fill-item-overflow-hidden html-fill-item\" id=\"htmlwidget-b694fc19268b2ad090d2\" style=\"width:100%;height:464px;\"></div>\n<script type=\"application/json\" data-for=\"htmlwidget-b694fc19268b2ad090d2\">{\"x\":{\"diagram\":\"\\n       digraph simple {\\n  rankdir = LR\\n  graph [overlap = true, fontsize = 10, layout = neato]\\n  node [shape = box]\\n  X[pos=\\\"0,0!\\\", label=<X<sub>i<\\/sub>>]\\n  Y[pos=\\\"2,0!\\\", label=<Y<sub>i<\\/sub>>]\\n  X -> Y[label=<&beta;>]\\n  node [shape = circle]\\n  e[pos=\\\"2,1!\\\", label=<&epsilon;<sub>i<\\/sub>>]\\n  e -> Y\\n}\\n\",\"config\":{\"engine\":\"dot\",\"options\":null}},\"evals\":[],\"jsHooks\":[]}</script>\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nHere is the general form of a numerical model (an equation) with the three main components:\n$$\n\\text{DATA} = \\text{MODEL} + \\text{ERROR}\n$$\n where,\n \n-   **DATA** = What we want to understand or explain\n-   **MODEL** = A simpler representation of the DATA\n-   **ERROR** = Amount by which the model fails to explain the data\n\nWhat is another term for error?\n\nWe could take our graphical model and turn it into an equation:\n\n$$\n\\text{Smoking} = \\text{Friend Smokes} + \\text{ERROR}\n$$\n\n### A Simple Model\n\n#### A mathematical representation\n\n$$\n\\text{DATA} = \\text{MODEL} + \\text{ERROR}\n$$ Population model:\n\n$$\nY_i = \\beta_0 + \\varepsilon_i\n$$\n\nSample model:\n\n$$\ny_i = b_0 + e_i\n$$\n\n## Describing Error\n\n### Simplest Model\n\n#### Zero Parameters\n\n$$\nY_i = B_0 + \\varepsilon_i\n$$\n\nWhere $B_0$ is some a priori value, not based on these DATA, but\nprovided by some theoretical consideration\n\n-   e.g. temperature = 98.6 degrees\n-   probability if coin is fair = .50\n-   change over time = 0\n\nNot common in behavioral sciences\n\n### Simple Model\n\n#### One Parameter\n\n$$\nY_i = \\beta_0 + \\varepsilon_i\n$$ Where $\\beta_0$ is an unknown value. The MODEL makes a constant\nprediction for all cases, but the value of that prediction is to be\nestimated from the data, so to make ERROR as small as possible.\n\nThe estimated MODEL is\n\n$$\nY_i = b_0 + e_i\n$$\n\nWhere $b_0$ is the actual prediction made for each case, estimated from\nthe data, minimizing ERROR.\n\nThis estimated MODEL can also be written as\n\n$$\n\\hat{Y_i} = b_0\n$$\n\nNote the difference between the two errors in the parameter model (\n$\\varepsilon_i$ ) and the estimated model ( $e_i$ ). The latter is an\nestimate of the former, just as $b_0$ is an estimate of $\\beta_0$.\n\n$$\n\\varepsilon_i = Y_i - \\beta_0\n$$\n\n$$\ne_i = Y_i - b_0 = Y_i - \\hat{Y_i}\n$$\n\n### Measures of Central Tendency and Dispersion\n\n-   Want to find best estimate of $\\beta_0$ that minimizes not\n    individual $e_i$'s but some aggregate measure of error.\n-   Different ways of aggregating errors lead to different estimates -\n    alternative measures of Central Tendency\n-   Different ways of aggregating errors lead to different estimates of\n    \"Typical Error\" - alternative measures of Spread\n-   This is \"descriptive statistics\"\n\n### Measures of Central Tendency and Dispersion\n\n-   Minimize Sum of Errors? - Why not?\n\n-   Minimize Sum of Absolute Errors (SAE). - best estimate of $\\beta_0$\n    is the Median\n\n-   What happens in presence of extreme outlier?\n\n-   Absolute Errors and Outliers\n\n-   Median Absolute Deviation (MAD) as typical measure of spread (median\n    value of $e_i$ given minimization of SAE)\n\n### Measures of Central Tendency and Dispersion\n\n-   Minimize Sum of Squared Errors. Why?\n    -   best estimate of $\\beta_0$ is the Mean\n-   What happens in presence of outlier?\n    -   Squared Errors and Outliers -Mean Square Error (Variance) as\n        typical measure of spread (mean value of $e_i^2$ given\n        minimization of SSE)\n\n### Formalities of Estimation\n\n#### Simple Model\n\nDATA = MODEL + ERROR\n\n$$\nY_i = \\beta_0 + \\varepsilon_i\n$$ $$\nY_i = b_0 + e_i\n$$ $$\n\\hat{Y_i} = b_0\n$$ $$\nY_i = \\hat{Y_i} + e_i\n$$\n\n$$\ne_i = Y_i - \\hat{Y_i}\n$$\n\n\n##### Aggregate Error: Sum of Absolute Errors\n\n$$\\text{Error} = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} |e_i| = \\sum_{i=1}^{n}|Y_i - \\hat{Y_i} | = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} | Y_i - b_0|$$\n\n-   Minimization estimates $\\beta_0$ as the Median\n-   Measure of Spread: Median Absolute Error or Median Absolute\n    Deviation (MAD)\n\n#####   Aggregate Error: Sum of Squared Errors\n\n$$\\text{Error} = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} e_i^2 = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (Y_i - \\hat{Y_i})^2 = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (Y_i - b_0)^2 = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (Y_i - \\bar{Y})^2$$\n\n-   Minimization estimates $\\beta_0$ as the Mean\n-   Measure of Spread: Mean Squared Error (Variance)\n\n### Mean Squared Error Estimation\n\n-   Recall that if one estimated $n$ parameters, ERROR would be zero.\\\n-   In computation of the MSE, we want to take into account the number\n    of parameters estimated (and the number of additional parameters\n    that could be estimated).\n-   General formula for MSE:\n\n$$\\text{MSE} = \\frac{ \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (Y_i - \\hat{Y_i})^2}{n-p}$$\n\n-   Square root known as the \"root mean square error\"\n\n### Mean Squared Error Estimation\n\n-   In case of simple one-parameter model, $p = 1$ and\n\n$$\\hat{Y_i} = b_0 = \\bar{Y}$$\n\nAccordingly,\n\n$$\\text{MSE} = \\frac{ \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (Y_i - \\hat{Y_i})^2}{n-1} = s^2$$\n\n-   And root mean square error is called the standard deviation\n\n-   So variance is special case of MSE; MSE as unbiased measure of\n    spread (or variance) of errors\n\n-   Usual notion: descriptive statistics\n\n-   Pick a measure of central tendency (mean, median, mode)\n\n-   Pick a measure of spread\n\n-   NO - pick a measure of aggregate error, estimates of $\\beta_0$\n    follow from that, along with estimates of typical error.\n\n## An Example\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n       vars  n  mean   sd median trimmed  mad  min max range skew kurtosis   se\nrepht     1 12 67.83 3.66  68.00   67.80 2.97 61.0  75  14.0 0.10    -0.51 1.06\nheight    2 12 68.58 3.37  68.25   68.55 2.59 62.5  75  12.5 0.13    -0.72 0.97\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n           repht    height\nrepht  1.0000000 0.9804921\nheight 0.9804921 1.0000000\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Distribution of measured heights\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](methodsoverview_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](methodsoverview_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n",
