    "markdown": "---\ntitle: \"R Script snippets\"\n---\n\n\nOne of the many features of RStudio that make R coding easier is the ability to use code snippets, which expand the general auto complete options for certain common code forms.\nFor example, if you type `lib` in the RStudio console or script editor you will see an auto complete menu pop up with a snipped for the `library()` function. \nThis would allow you to select this snippet and it would insert `library(package)` at the cursor, with the word \"package\" highlighted. \nYou could then type in the name of the package you wanted to load and hit tab to complete the snippet. \nSee [here](https://support.posit.co/hc/en-us/articles/204463668-Code-Snippets-in-the-RStudio-IDE) for more about RStudio snippets.\n\nYou can also create your own snippets, and I want to show how to create a R code script header that I use often.\nThis allows me to start typing the word `script` at the beginning of an R script and RStudio inserts a header template like this:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# -----------------------------------------------------------------------\n# Title: title\n# Author: William Murrah\n# Description: description\n# Created: Monday, 23 January 2023\n# R version: R version 4.2.2 (2022-10-31)\n# Project(working) directory: /Users/wmm0017/Projects/QMER/statistical-thinking\n# -----------------------------------------------------------------------\n```\n:::\n\n\nThen, I can insert a title, and description and I have a nice header with important information.\n\nTo set this up first copy the text below:\n\n[R snippit code](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/auqmer/statistical-thinking/main/code/snippet.txt)\n\n\nThen go to **Tools** in the RStudio menu, then click **Global Options...**, click the  **Code** tab go to the bottom and check the Code Snippets box.\nThen click on Edit Snippets, scroll to the bottom.\nMake sure you skip a blank line at the bottom and paste the above code, making sure to replace `YOUR NAME` with your name. \nTab spacing and alignment are important.\nThe word snippet should be flush with the left margin, and all other lines should be indented two spaces.\nIf the snippet you inserted isn't highlighted the way the ones just above it in the Edit Snippets window, you likely have a spacing error.\nOnce you have this entered correctly, hit Save, then Ok.\nNow you should be able to start typing the word script inside an R script and get the script snippet.\n\nSee the following video for a demonstration:\n\n\n",
