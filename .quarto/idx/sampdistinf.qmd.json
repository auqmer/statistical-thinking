Linear Regression\n\n## Hypotheses\n\n* An hypothesis is a testable statement about a **population**.\n* It takes the form of a prediction about the value or range of values a **parameter** takes.\n\n## The *p*-value\n\nA *p*-value is the probability of obtaining data as extreme or more extreme as obtained in the sample given that the null hypothesis is true. \n\n*p*-value :\n\n$$\n p = P(D | H_0)\n$$\n\n## Observational Learning Albert Bandura (1965)\n\n### Influence of Models' Reinforcement Contingencies on the acquisition of Imitative Responses\n\nIn order to test the hypothesis that reinforcements administered to a model\ninfluence the performance but not the acquisition of matching responses, groups\nof children observed an aggressive film-mediated model either rewarded,\npunished, or left without consequences. A postexposure test revealed that\nresponse consequences to the model had produced differential amounts of\nimitative behavior. Children in the model-punished condition performed significantly fewer matching responses than children in both the model-rewarded\nand the no-consequences groups. Children in all 3 treatment conditions were\nthen offered attractive reinforcers contingent on their reproducing the model's\naggressive responses. The introduction of positive incentives completely wiped\nout the previously observed performance differences, revealing an equivalent\namount of learning among children in the model-rewarded, model-punished,\nand the no-consequences conditions.\n\n## Hypotheses\n\n$H_0$: ???\n\n* $H_1$: It was predicted that reinforcing consequences to the model would result in significant differences in the performance of imitative behavior with the model-rewarded group displaying the highest number of different classes of matching responses, followed by the no-consequences and the model-punished groups, respectively.\n\n* $H_2$: In accordance with previous findings (Bandura et al., 1961, 1963a) it was also expected that boys would perform significantly more imitative aggression than girls.\n\n* $H_3$: It was predicted, however, that the introduction of positive incentives would wipe out both reinforcement-produced and sex-linked performance differences, revealing an equivalent amount of learning among children in the three treatment conditions.\n\n\n### Figure 1.
